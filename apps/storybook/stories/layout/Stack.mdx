# Stack

## Used to layout its children in a vertical or horizontal stack.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.Basic} />

## Anatomy

By default, `Stack` applies `flex-direction: column` and `gap: 0.5rem` (8px) to its children.

```tsx
<script>
	import { Stack } from "$saas/layout/stack";
</script>

<Stack>
	<div />
	<div />
</Stack>
```

## Examples

### Horizontal

Use the `direction` prop to change the direction of the stack.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.Horizontal} />

### HStack

Alternatively, you can use the HStack to create a horizontal stack and align its children horizontally.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.WithHStack} />

### VStack

Use the VStack to create a vertical stack and align its children vertically.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.WithVStack} />

### Separator

Use the Divider component to add a separator between the stack items.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.WithSeparator} />

### Responsive Direction

Use Tailwind utility classes (e.g., md:flex-row) to change the direction of the stack responsively.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.Responsive} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={Stack} exclude={stackPattern} />
